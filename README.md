# SW-MCU-STM32-BlinkTest-001

Here is a blink file for STM32 microcontrollers.

I use 3 type of blinks for debugging.

Type 1: this to test led
Type 2: this to check loops
Type 3: this to check uploads

A LED can save you hours for debugging, if you are writing large chunk of code. Use it wisely.

Hope this helps you,
